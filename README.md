# stellaris-no_diplomatic_vassalization
For a stellaris mod relating to no diplomatic vassalization.

EN DESC:
  Removes the ability for both the player and the AI to request to be subjugated and demand the subjugation of other empires. Keep in mind that both you and the AI can still go to war to subjugate other empires. 

  This does NOT work in Ironman Mode.

  Untested for compatibility with other mods.
